# Baishakhi_layout_multiling
Baishakhi layout is actually developed by SNLTR, a Govt. of India organization. This layout is phonetic in nature with Normal, Shift and Right Alt modes, designed to accommodate all the Bangla alphabetical signs and symbols. I imported this keyboard for MultilingOkeyboard for android.
